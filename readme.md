# Quantum Blot

Quantum Blot is an exploratory project for experimenting with text embeddings and
quantum-enhanced dimensionality reduction. The code base provides utilities for
producing embeddings, performing PCA reduction on either CPU or GPU, and
prototype quantum PCA circuits using Qiskit. A thin Typer-powered CLI and a
sample demonstration notebook illustrate the intended workflow. Implementation
is left as an exercise for contributors.
